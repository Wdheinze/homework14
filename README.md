Throughout this semester I have found each project to build on each other. From the start of this semester to the end. 
Node js, where do I even start. When I first looked at this I was confused on what it even did. I find it facinating how I can use
Node js to create and run my own server. To be honest I did not really understand Node.js at first. It confused me more then anything I had
ever learned in this class. I then realized that by opening a single string server by using node.js it was really just like live server. 
I personally think that if someone could not access liveserver then Node would be very realiable. How it ties into this class is this is a 
Web technologies class. Throughout the class we have learned how to code and use a bunch of different tools to build websites and projects 
that we probably could have only dreamed about before hand. Node.js is a program in which we open a server and are able to build our applications
or websites faster on.
